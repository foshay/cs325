    1.a
        Always choose the best bang for your buck. Cost/value.
    1.b
        Counter example is a bag of capacity 3 and two items,
        (2,4),(3,5). You would choose the 2,4 item and not be able to fit
        any more items which is not the optimal solution.
    1.c
        opt[W] is the best solution, or maximum value, for a bag of W capacity.
    1.d
        opt[W] = max(opt-w_i + a[i]) for 0-i while W>=0
    1.e
        opt[0] = 0 ; w_i <= W
    1.f
        O(WN) where W is the capacity of the knapsack and N is the number of items
    2.a
        Always choose the best bang for your buck Cost/value
    2.b
        Counter example is the same as problem 1.
    2.c
        opt[W,k] is the best solution between taking items or leaving items.
    2.d
        opt[W,k] = max(opt[W-w_i,k-1]+a[i], opt[W-w_i,k-1]) where the weight
        is related to how many of one item we will take.
    2.e
        opt[_,0] = 0 opt[0,_] = 0. w_i <= W
    2.f
        O(WN) where W is the capacity of the knapsack and N is the number of items
        to choose from.

    1. 14
    2. Difficult
    3. Mostly alone I cried with some fellow students a couple times
    4. 40%
    5. I love that I can rewatch the lectures. I watched the last 2 lectures probably
    4-5 times each
    6. I dislike the jump in difficulty, as well as the participation system.
