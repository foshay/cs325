    2. difficult but was easy becuase liang gave us the answer to kbest in class
    3. Mostly alone but had help
    4. 80%
    5. Coding sessions are nice but gave the answer away. If there was a way to do a coding session that showed how to solve a similar problem or used the same concepts instead of just solving the problem for everyone that might make people learn more.
